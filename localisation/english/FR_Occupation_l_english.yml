Cracks of rifle fire can still be heard in Bern as it is becoming clear we are not all that welcome in Switzerland. We may want to consider releasing a friendly government in the mountain fortress so that more of our men are not felled by Swiss Militia’s, or we could carry on the occupation, potentially at great cost."
occupation.3.d:0 "The Swedish nation has fallen under our boots and the residents of Stockholm watch in horror as our troops march heroically down their streets.

occupation.4.d:0 "Brutal fighting in the Fjords and Mountains of Norway has led to our occupation of the nation and occupation of the city of Oslo. Controlling a large, sparsely populated nation effectively may be difficult, although many predict resistance may be limited due to the small population. We therefore must choose whether we are to occupy the nation in full and totally annex it, or if we are to release a loyal Norwegian state."

Or we may want to consider releasing a Palestinian Arab state for the Arab Muslim and Christian populations of these lands. Or, it may be worth occupying the land in its entirety, as the previous options with not please everyone in these lands, and we may have designs on this territory."
