This mod aims to solve the issue of "border gore" by integrating a peace conference system and post-annexation decisions inspired by Kaiserreich. The AI will only annex territories during the peace conference, without releasing puppets. Instead, decisions and events for puppet releases will appear in the following days as long as you own the capital city state (these decisions can also be used by the AI), annexation decisions are not available at war.

This mod includes additional features such as:

-An automatic claim assignment system.

-The ability to request your own claims from puppets.

-The option to transfer allies' cores and claims within a faction (as long as they are not your own).

-The ability to grant puppets territories that are their cores.

-A dynamic puppet system in case a country is split in two (e.g., East Germany and West Germany).

-There are also decisions to assign specific regions to one puppet over another, such as Dalmatia, Alsace-Lorraine, Trentino-Alto Adige, Savoy, and more.

-A new Reichskommissariat system with custom portraits and flags, disableable via a gamerule

-A new system of redistribution of states that are completely inaccessible either by land or by sea, forcing the annexation of states necessarily adjacent or connected by sea

Release decisions won't appear while at war and can't be used by subjects , to trigger the annexation decision you have to own the capital state of the country, alternativly you can create a dynamic puppet if you own part of their territory.
